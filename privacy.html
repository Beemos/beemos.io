      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Treemonster, LLC (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the “Application”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you
        install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which
        may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data
        collected by any such third party.
      </p>


      <h2>Collection of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may
        collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:
      </p>
      <h3>Financial Data</h3>
      <p>
        Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g. valid credit
        card number, card brand, expiration date) that we may collect when you purchase,
        order, return, exchange, or request information about our services from the Application.
        We store only very limited, if any, financial information that we collect. Otherwise, all
        financial information is stored by our payment processor, Stripe, and you are
        encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to
        your questions.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth,
        efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected
        about you via the Application to:
        <ul>
          <li>Process payments and refunds.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:
      </p>
      <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
      <p>
        If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal
        process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the
        rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or
        required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information
        with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
      </p>
      <h3>Third-Party Advertisers</h3>
      <p>
        We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the
        Application. These companies may use information about your visits to the Application
        and other websites that are contained in web cookies in order to provide advertisements
        about goods and services of interest to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Third Parties</h3>
      <p>
        We may share your information with advertisers and investors for the purpose of
        conducting general business analysis. We may also share your information with such
        third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.
      </p>
      <h3>Sale or Bankruptcy</h3>
      <p>
        If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired
        by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out
        of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or
        acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the
        transferee may decline honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy. We are not
        responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive
        data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations. If you no
        longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third
        parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.
      </p>

      <h2>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Internet-Based Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Additionally, we may use third-party software to serve ads on the Application, implement
        email marketing campaigns, and manage other interactive marketing initiatives. This
        third-party software may use cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and
        optimize your online experience with us. For more information about opting-out of
        interest-based ads, visit the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool</a> or <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/" target="_blank">Digital
        Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
      <p>
        The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest,
        including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you
        have used these links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these
        third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety
        and privacy of your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any
        third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if
        any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps
        necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not
        responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third
        parties, including other sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the
        Application.
      </p>

      <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your
        personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal
        information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security
        measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be
        guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy for Children</h2>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If
        you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please
        contact us using the contact information provided below.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls for DO-NOT-TRACK Features</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track
        (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
        data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
        technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
        As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits
        our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and
        free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we
        disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of
        all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding
        calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
        please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account
        with the Application, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you
        publicly post on the Application. To request removal of such data, please contact us
        using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated
        with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the
        data is not publicly displayed on the Application, but please be aware that the data may
        not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
      </p>
